XML is a markup language that was designed to store and transport data.
XML stores data in plain text format.
This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data.
With XML, data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines" like people, computers, voice machines, news feeds, etc.
