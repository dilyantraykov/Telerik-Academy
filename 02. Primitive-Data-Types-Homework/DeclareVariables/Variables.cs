// Problem 1. Declare Variables

// Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
// Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. Try to compile the code.

using System;

class Variables
{
    static void Main()
    {
        ushort a = 52130;
        sbyte b = -115;
        int c = 4825932;
        byte d = 97;
        short e = -10000;
    }
}
